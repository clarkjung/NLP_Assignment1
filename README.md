=====================

Natural Language Process Assignment1

Task1: Language modelling
● Calculate the perplexity of the corpus
● Split in training (90%) and test (10%) sets
  - Randomly and per document
  - Build a language model using the training set (Maximum Likelihood, bigram)
  - Use Laplace (Add-one) smoothing for the zero probabilities Estimate probabilities on the test set

Task1: Part-of-speech tagging
● Calculate precision for the corpus
● Split in training (90%) and test (10%) sets
  - Randomly and per document
  - Learn the model using the training set (Hidden Markov Model, bigram)
  - Predict POS tags for the test set
